# This is a test.

# draft 1: In the format of the project (use as a starting point the qmd for 405 or Rnw for 605 provided 
# in Module 1, respecting the YAML in terms of spacing and font type) submit a pdf containing:
# 1. The running title of your project
# 2. The members of the group (authors)
# 3. An introduction to your project and dataset,
# 4. Six professional looking plots done exclusively with base graphics functions (no ggplot, that will be used in the following draft) 
# that feature the main data of your project (the one that has been approved by the Instructor). Make sure that each of the plots has the 
# corresponding introduction and interpretation (you should not expect that the reader is the one interpreting your work, of which you are the expert). 
# Keep in mind that all six plots need to be of a different kind (for example, you cannot produce two histograms).
# 5. Some kind of starting statistical modeling (such as, but not limited to, a regression analysis). Interpret your results.
